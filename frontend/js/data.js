Your expertise will be crucial in ensuring our 24/7 operations remain seamless and efficient.\r\n\r\nAbout the role:\r\n- Undertake day-to-day reactive and planned engineering maintenance activities and improvement works at the CFC.\r\n- Work closely with Inbound, Outbound, and other support teams to optimise availability and performance of the facility and its mechanical handling equipment (MHE).\r\n- Diagnose equipment breakdowns and action repairs where possible.\r\n- Analyse data and identify solutions to improve MHE performance.\r\n- Report and monitor data relating to automation and maintenance activities.\r\nYour shift pattern:\r\n- 12-hour shifts averaging 42 hours per week.\r\n- Includes weekdays and weekends, with a rotating pattern of days and nights.\r\n- Holiday entitlement: 264 hours annually (equivalent to 22 days).\r\nTo be successful in this hands-on role, you must meet the following essential criteria:\r\n- Demonstrable, current hands-on mechanical and electrical engineering experience with traditional industrial machinery such as cogs, conveyors, and heavy plant equipment. This experience must be recent—within the last 6 months.\r\n- Proven electrical manufacturing experience in addition to your mechanical expertise.\r\n- A Level 3 engineering qualification (e.g., NVQ Level 3, BTEC National Diploma, or equivalent) in an electrical or mechanical discipline.\r\n- We are particularly interested in candidates who have gained their experience in demanding, hands-on environments such as Network Rail, the Armed Forces, heavy manufacturing, or traditional warehouse/logistics operations.\r\n- A natural problem solver, experienced in working with control systems, analysing faults, and providing practical solutions.\r\n- An organised, capable team player with excellent communication skills.\r\nFull training will be provided over 5 weeks to help you fully integrate into the technician role. Experience working in an automated warehouse or logistics environment is desirable. Flexibility in working pattern may be required depending on business needs.\r\nWhat we offer you:\r\nAt Ocado Logistics, we offer competitive salaries and so much more:\r\n- Up to 7% matched pension contributions after three months of service\r\n- Employer-funded private medical insurance\r\n- Company shop offering discounts up to 70% on groceries from leading brands and major retailers\r\n- Enhanced digital health and wellbeing service for you and your dependents\r\n- Financial protection: income protection and life insurance\r\n- High street and restaurant discounts including 15% off at ocado.com\r\n- Option to buy additional holidays\r\n\r\nHere at Ocado Logistics, our people, technology, and customers work side by side, supporting the amazing communities we serve.

If you start your journey with us between August 4th and August 22nd, you'll kick off your training and initial deliveries from our Dordon site.

We believe in supporting our heroes from day one. Any additional travel costs incurred during this transition period will be fully covered by Ocado Logistics!

Our incredible training team will equip you with all the skills you need to become a Local Legend.\r\nHowever, it goes without saying you will need some essentials…\r\n- Full UK or EU driving licence.\r\n- Minimum of 6 months driving experience (although 12 months driving experience is desirable!).\r\n- Maximum of 6 penalty points.\r\n- No driving disqualifications in the past 5 years.\r\nSome deliveries involve the handling of alcohol products, so you must be over 18 to apply.\r\nAs this is a customer-facing role, good communication skills and the ability to deliver joy to our customers goes without saying.\r\nHow to apply:\r\n- Fill in an online application - there is no CV needed!\r\n- Our friendly recruitment team will get in touch to conduct an Online Licence Check and Right to Work Checks.\r\n- You will be invited to find out more about the role, either through a site tour in Dordon or Nottingham after 25/08/2025.\r\n- We will run a Disclosure Barring System check (DBS).\r\n- Once all checks are completed, you will be offered the role and your career with Ocado Logistics will start!\r\nContract Type: Permanent\r\nContract Hours: 40 hours (including paid breaks)\r\nContracted days: You will be required to work any 5 days out of 7 doing 8 hour shifts and will be provided with further information during pre-boarding.\r\nShifts: AM & PM.

        "Here at Ocado Logistics, it’s our mission to provide an outstanding customer experience for our partners, developing ground-breaking technology, opening multiple sites at an accelerating rate and engaging in exciting new business partnerships around the world - changing the way the world shops, for good.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are the beating heart of our UK business and comprise a network of cutting-edge warehouses and offices across the country that ensure that we optimise the experience and use our proprietary technology across the supply chain to deliver an exceptional shopping experience. At the same time, delivering bags of possibilities for our employees and a career that will ensure no two days are ever the same.\r\n\r\nAbout the role\r\n\r\nWe wouldn’t be able to positively impact the way the world shops without our passionate team members - who keep our business running, our vans delivering, our customers' products picked and packed, and our proprietary technology operating at optimum levels.

This role is critical in supporting our data-driven approach to improving processes and driving business performance.\r\n\r\nAs an Analyst, you will:\r\n- Using your analytical skills to extract, interpret, and visualise data to support decision-making.\r\n- Supporting the consolidation of data from multiple sources across Logistics, ensuring accuracy and consistency.\r\n- Identifying trends and conducting root cause analysis to improve key performance indicators.\r\n- Collaborating with various teams across Logistics, Finance, and Technology to contribute to strategic projects.\r\n- Ensuring compliance with best practice security management in all data-related tasks.\r\n\r\nAbout you - Requirements to be considered:\r\n- Strong data analysis and problem-solving skills.\r\n- Technical proficiency in SQL, VBA, or other relevant programming/scripting languages.\r\n- Experience using and building BI tools to create insightful reports.\r\n- Ability to collaborate effectively with different departments and stakeholders.\r\n- Strong communication skills to present findings and recommendations clearly.\r\n\r\nIn the interview, we would like you to:\r\n- Deliver insight-driven analysis that provides real business value.\r\n- Clearly explain the ‘why’ behind the data and its impact on decision-making.\r\n- Use data storytelling techniques, such as the STAR method, to communicate insights effectively.\r\n\r\nInterview Process Overview:\r\n- Intro (30 mins) – Phone/Google Meet with Lead Recruiter, Richard Wandowski.\r\n- Case Study – Successfully screened candidates will complete a short case study task.\r\n- Interviews – There may be one or two interview stages, depending on the role's requirements. These will focus on scenario-based, behavioural, and experience-related questions, as well as a discussion on case study performance.\r\n\r\nWe have multiple openings across the broader department, working across various verticals, with immediate start dates available. During the initial screening call, Richard Wandowski will discuss your skills, experience, and preferences to determine the best fit for you within the team.\r\n\r\nPlease note: This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship. Candidates must already have the right to work in the UK for the duration of the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect to receive in return\r\n\r\nAt Ocado, we believe in a workplace where everyone feels valued and supported, so you’ll find a safe and collaborative atmosphere as well as an award-winning recognition programme and benefits package that includes a healthy work-life balance, extensive healthcare coverage, competitive salaries, and exclusive employee discounts.\r\n\r\nIncluding:\r\n\r\n- Flexible Work: Enjoy 30 days of 'work from anywhere' policy for a balanced life.\r\n- Wellbeing Support: Access dedicated apps and an Employee Assistance Programme for holistic well-being.\r\n- Generous Leave: Begin with 25 days, growing to 27 after 5 years, with an option to buy more.\r\n- Pension Plan: Secure your future with our pension scheme, featuring up to 7% employer contribution matching.\r\n- Private Medical Cover: Rest easy with comprehensive private medical insurance.\r\n- Family-Friendly: We support your family with maternity, adoption, shared parental leave, and paternity leave.\r\n- Financial Aid: Get interest-free train tickets and join our Cycle to Work Scheme.\r\n- Shuttle Services: Convenient free shuttle buses connect you to work.\r\n- Share Schemes: Join exciting share plans to participate in our success.\r\n- Shopping Perks: Enjoy a 15% discount on Ocado.com and savings at popular retailers and restaurants.\r\n- Financial Protection: We offer Income Protection and Life Insurance for financial security.\r\n\r\n\r\nOcado Group is an equal opportunities employer and as such makes every effort to ensure that all potential employees are treated fairly and equally, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, marital status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, age, disability, or union membership status.
